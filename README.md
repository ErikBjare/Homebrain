## Usage

### Installation

Install dependencies with `python3 setup.py install`, if you are going to develop run `python3 setup.py develop` instead ([Why?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19048732/python-setup-py-develop-vs-install)).

### Running it

Run with `homebrain`


## Development

There is a [**Slack**](https://homebrain.slack.com/) for team communication and a [**Trello board**](https://trello.com/b/qTIPOiPS/homebrain) for planning.

### Tests

The most convenient way to run the tests is with nose. Install with `pip3 install nose` and run with `nosetests` from the root directory of the project.

Tests are run automatically on Codeship (see the badge near the top of the README).
